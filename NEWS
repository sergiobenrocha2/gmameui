* Modified handling of MAME audit processing to catch ROM errors and properly display invalid ROMs. Samples now shows Not Available samplesets

* Italian translation 100% (thanks Ugo Viti)

Overview of changes in GMAMEUI 0.2.4
====================================

* Fixed segfault when closing the Directories window with no ROM or Sample paths set

* Minor UI changes
  - Emulation can be started by pressing Enter
  - Set minimum column width based on column's title

  - Add support for setting cpanel directory

* Recording input files silently records to the .inp directory, creating it if it doesn't exist

* Code refactoring
  - Migrating gamelist to GObject for easier refactoring and maintenance
  - Migrate main window to Glade for UI generation
  - Fix some startup errors/warnings, particularly GTK-Critical ones relating to g_key_file and GError

* Setup directory and build structure for Help

* New translations:
    Italian translation (Ugo Viti)
    Brazilian translation (Junix)
